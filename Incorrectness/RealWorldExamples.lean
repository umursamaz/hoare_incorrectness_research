# Data-structure abstractions (advisor-requested form)

The state model in this project is fixed: `State = String → Nat`. To
faithfully encode the data structures the advisor asked for —
**"array as a map/function `Nat → Nat`"** and **"linked list with a
`Node` type, `next : Node → Node` and `key : Node → Nat` maps"** — we
do *not* extend the language. Instead we expose those maps as proper
Lean-level functions of the state. Each function reads a deterministic
naming scheme of state slots, so updating "the map at index `i`" is
realised by case-splitting on the runtime value of `i` and updating the
corresponding slot.

  arr     : State → Nat  → Nat     -- the array map (4-slot pool)
  keyOf   : State → Node → Nat     -- the key  map (3-node pool)
  nextOf  : State → Node → Node    -- the next map (3-node pool, 0 = NULL)

These definitions are `@[simp]` so once the iteration-counter case-split
fixes the index, the if-cascade reduces and proofs go through with the
existing `il_close` simp set.
-/

/-!
The encoding mirrors a C `struct Node { unsigned int key; Node* next; };`:

  • `Node` is a node identifier (a `Nat`). The value `0` is NULL.
  • `key  : Node → Nat`   ─ each node has a key field
  • `next : Node → Node`  ─ each node has a next-pointer field

In a purely functional setting the maps `key` and `next` must close over the
*current* heap, because the program mutates them (`key_3 := target`,
`next_2 := 3`). We expose that by giving each map a `State` parameter:
`keyOf s` is the `Node → Nat` map *at state s*. Fix `s` and you get the
abstract `Node → Nat` field.

Slots are addressed by `s!"key_{n}"` / `s!"next_{n}"`, so there is no
hard-coded bound on the node count — the encoding works for any
`Node = Nat`. -/

## Bridging definitions and `simp`

The definitions above already reduce by `rfl`: for *any* `n : Nat` literal,
`keyOf s n` is definitionally `s "key_<n>"`. The two `example`s just above
demonstrate this for `n = 4, 42, 17` — no per-literal lemma needed.

However, `simp` by itself does not normalise `Nat.repr n` for concrete `n`
inside string interpolation. We bridge this with one **simproc** —
fifteen lines of meta-code that match `keyOf s n` / `nextOf s n` / `arr s i`
for *any* Nat literal `n` and rewrite to the corresponding slot read by
`rfl`. The result: minimal proof boilerplate, maximum automation. -/

# Real-World Bug Detection Examples

This file collects examples that mimic *realistic* bug patterns
found in production code, encoded within our Nat-only state model.
Each example demonstrates that an IL triple of the form
`[precondition] buggy_program [bug_state]` is **provable**, meaning
the bug state is genuinely reachable from the precondition.

In standard usage the user writes a postcondition describing the
*intended* outcome and `incorrectness_auto` proves whether a state
violating that intent is reachable. When the proof succeeds, a bug
exists; when it fails, the bug pattern doesn't manifest in our model.

Each example is closed by a single tactic call (the unified
`incorrectness_auto` dispatcher), which internally tries the
loop-free path first and falls back to bounded while search.

The bug categories covered here:

| # | Category                            | Loop? |
|---|-------------------------------------|-------|
| 1 | `<` vs `≤` in withdrawal check      | no    |
| 2 | `≥` vs `>` in discount threshold    | no    |
| 3 | `>` vs `≥` in age verification      | no    |
| 4 | Logical AND vs OR in access control | no    |
| 5 | Off-by-one: loop-counter starts at 0 | yes  |
| 6 | `≤` vs `<` in loop guard            | yes   |
| 7 | Loop runs one extra time            | yes   |
| 8 | Two-stage validation, second stage skipped | no |
-/

-- =============================================================
-- Example 1 — Bank withdrawal validator: `<` instead of `≤`
-- =============================================================
/-
A banking system *should* allow withdrawal whenever the requested
amount is ≤ balance. The buggy code uses strict `<`, so a request
equal to the balance is incorrectly rejected.

Scenario: balance = 100, withdrawal = 100. The user expects approval,
but the buggy program lands in the rejection branch. This bug state
is reachable, hence provable.
-/
example :
  [* (fun s => s "balance" = 100 ∧ s "withdrawal" = 100) *]
  (Stmt.ifThenElse
    (fun s => s "withdrawal" < s "balance")    -- BUG: should be ≤
    (Stmt.assign "approved" (fun _ => 1))
    (Stmt.assign "approved" (fun _ => 0)))
  [* (fun t => t "approved" = 0 ∧ t "balance" = 100 ∧ t "withdrawal" = 100) *] := by
  incorrectness_auto

-- =============================================================
-- Example 2 — Discount threshold: `≥` instead of `>`
-- =============================================================
/-
The pricing rule says "10% discount for orders over $1000".
A buggy implementation uses `≥`, applying the discount at exactly
$1000 when it shouldn't.

Scenario: amount = 1000. Buggy program applies the discount.
Bug state reachable.
-/
example :
  [* (fun s => s "amount" = 1000) *]
  (Stmt.ifThenElse
    (fun s => s "amount" ≥ 1000)               -- BUG: should be >
    (Stmt.assign "discounted" (fun _ => 1))
    (Stmt.assign "discounted" (fun _ => 0)))
  [* (fun t => t "discounted" = 1 ∧ t "amount" = 1000) *] := by
  incorrectness_auto

-- =============================================================
-- Example 3 — Age verification: `>` instead of `≥`
-- =============================================================
/-
Age gate should permit `age ≥ 18`. Buggy implementation uses strict
`>`, rejecting exactly-18-year-olds.

Scenario: age = 18. Buggy program denies access. Bug reachable.
-/
example :
  [* (fun s => s "age" = 18) *]
  (Stmt.ifThenElse
    (fun s => s "age" > 18)                    -- BUG: should be ≥
    (Stmt.assign "allowed" (fun _ => 1))
    (Stmt.assign "allowed" (fun _ => 0)))
  [* (fun t => t "allowed" = 0 ∧ t "age" = 18) *] := by
  incorrectness_auto

-- =============================================================
-- Example 4 — Access control: AND vs OR confusion
-- =============================================================
/-
A system should grant access only to users who are BOTH admin AND
active. The buggy version uses OR, so any active non-admin user
also gets access.

Scenario: admin = 0, active = 1. Buggy program grants access.
Privilege-escalation bug; reachable.
-/
example :
  [* (fun s => s "admin" = 0 ∧ s "active" = 1) *]
  (Stmt.ifThenElse
    (fun s => s "admin" = 1 ∨ s "active" = 1)  -- BUG: should be ∧
    (Stmt.assign "access" (fun _ => 1))
    (Stmt.assign "access" (fun _ => 0)))
  [* (fun t => t "access" = 1 ∧ t "admin" = 0 ∧ t "active" = 1) *] := by
  incorrectness_auto

-- =============================================================
-- Example 5 — Loop guard: `≤` instead of `<`
-- =============================================================
/-
A loop intended to run exactly 3 times (for x = 0, 1, 2) but the
buggy guard uses `≤ 3` instead of `< 3`, so it runs 4 times.

Final state: x = 4, when the programmer expected x = 3.
Bug reachable via 4 iterations.
-/
example :
  [* (fun s => s "x" = 0) *]
  (Stmt.whileDo
    (fun s => s "x" ≤ 3)                       -- BUG: should be < 3
    (Stmt.assign "x" (fun s => s "x" + 1)))
  [* (fun t => t "x" = 4) *] := by
  incorrectness_auto

-- =============================================================
-- Example 6 — Loop runs one extra iteration (`<` boundary)
-- =============================================================
/-
A loop processes counter from initial value 0 up to (but not
including) some threshold. The intended threshold is 5, but a
buggy off-by-one uses 6, running one extra time.
-/
example :
  [* (fun s => s "counter" = 0) *]
  (Stmt.whileDo
    (fun s => s "counter" < 6)                 -- BUG: intended 5
    (Stmt.assign "counter" (fun s => s "counter" + 1)))
  [* (fun t => t "counter" = 6) *] := by
  incorrectness_auto

-- =============================================================
-- Example 7 — Conditional bug + assignment in sequence
-- =============================================================
/-
A request validator: comparison bug grants access at boundary.
The bug: comparison uses `≥` instead of strict `>`. With input=50
and the threshold also 50, the buggy code proceeds to "approved"
state when it should not.
-/
example :
  [* (fun s => s "input" = 50) *]
  (Stmt.ifThenElse
    (fun s => s "input" ≥ 50)                  -- BUG: intended > 50
    (Stmt.assign "result" (fun _ => 1))        -- approved
    (Stmt.assign "result" (fun _ => 0)))       -- rejected
  [* (fun t => t "result" = 1 ∧ t "input" = 50) *] := by
  incorrectness_auto

-- =============================================================
-- Example 8 — Counter that wraps past intended limit
-- =============================================================
/-
A "rate limiter" intended to permit at most 3 requests but the
buggy guard uses a different threshold, allowing the counter to
exceed the intended cap.
-/
example :
  [* (fun s => s "requests" = 0) *]
  (Stmt.whileDo
    (fun s => s "requests" < 5)                -- BUG: intended 3
    (Stmt.assign "requests" (fun s => s "requests" + 1)))
  [* (fun t => t "requests" = 5) *] := by
  incorrectness_auto

-- =============================================================
-- Example 9 — Sequence of assertions that miss a case
-- =============================================================
/-
A pipeline that asserts intermediate properties. The first assert
catches malformed input. But the assert is too lax: it only checks
`x ≠ 0`, missing the case `x = 1` which the rest of the program
treats specially. After the assert succeeds for x = 1, the program
proceeds to a wrong branch.
-/
example :
  [* (fun s => s "x" = 1) *]
  (Stmt.seq
    (Stmt.assert (fun s => s "x" ≠ 0))         -- assert too weak
    (Stmt.ifThenElse
      (fun s => s "x" > 1)
      (Stmt.assign "result" (fun _ => 100))
      (Stmt.assign "result" (fun _ => 999))))  -- "error sentinel"
  [* (fun t => t "result" = 999 ∧ t "x" = 1) *] := by
  incorrectness_auto

-- =============================================================
-- Example 10 — Nested loops where outer escapes too early
-- =============================================================
/-
An outer loop that's supposed to cover all values but the inner
loop's side effect on the outer counter causes early exit.

Here we encode a single while loop where the body advances `x` by
1, but a second variable `y` should remain 0 — yet the buggy body
also touches `y`. After 2 iterations: x=2, y=2 (not the intended
y=0). The bug: y mutated unintentionally.
-/
example :
  [* (fun s => s "x" = 0 ∧ s "y" = 0) *]
  (Stmt.whileDo
    (fun s => s "x" < 2)
    (Stmt.seq
      (Stmt.assign "x" (fun s => s "x" + 1))
      (Stmt.assign "y" (fun s => s "y" + 1))))   -- BUG: y not supposed to change
  [* (fun t => t "x" = 2 ∧ t "y" = 2) *] := by
  incorrectness_auto

-- =============================================================
-- Example 11 — Sorted array insert with shift: `<` vs `≤` bug
-- =============================================================
/-
**The classic sorted-array insert duplication bug** — full pipeline:
find-position loop *and* element-shifting, producing a verified
duplicate in the final array.

## The array as a map

Conceptually the array is a map `Nat → Nat`. We encode a 4-slot
fixed-capacity array via state variables `a0, a1, a2, a3`, plus a
length `len`. The runtime "function view" `a[i]` is the Lean
expression `if i = 0 then s "a0" else if i = 1 then s "a1" else …`.

## The algorithm (sorted-insert avoiding duplicates)

  -- Phase 1: scan to find the right insert index (loop)
  i := 0
  while i < len ∧ a[i] ≤ target:     -- BUG: should use strict `<`
    i := i + 1
  pos := i

  -- Phase 2: shift elements [pos .. len-1] one slot right
  a3 := if pos ≤ 2 then a2 else a3
  a2 := if pos ≤ 1 then a1 else a2
  a1 := if pos ≤ 0 then a0 else a1
  -- write target at the freed slot
  (assign target to the appropriate slot)
  len := len + 1

The bug: the `≤` walks past an equal element. Combined with the
shift+insert phase, this places the new value *after* the existing
equal element rather than skipping insertion.

## Concrete trace, target = 3, initial [1, 3, 5]

  Phase 1 (buggy):
    i=0  a0=1 ≤ 3 ✓ → i=1
    i=1  a1=3 ≤ 3 ✓ (BUG, equals!) → i=2
    i=2  a2=5 ≤ 3 ✗ → exit
    pos := 2

  Phase 2 (shift+insert at pos=2):
    a3 := a2 = 5       (shift)
    a2 unchanged (pos ≤ 1 is false)
    a1 unchanged (pos ≤ 0 is false)
    a2 := 3            (write target at pos=2)
    len := 4

  Final array: [1, 3, 3, 5]   ← duplicate!  Bug demonstrated.

## What we prove

The IL triple is `[initial] full_program [duplicate_state]`. We split
the program at the seq boundary using `seq_intro`:
- Phase 1 is closed by `incorrectness_auto_inv_split` with an indexed
  invariant tracking `i` and `pos`.
- Phase 2 (loop-free) is closed by `incorrectness_auto`.

The intermediate assertion captures the state after Phase 1:
`pos = 2`, all array values unchanged, etc.

-- =============================================================
-- Example 12 — Pointer-based sorted-list insert: `<` vs `≤` bug
-- =============================================================
/-
**The pointer-based variant of Example 11** — same `<` vs `≤` mistake,
but now on a real singly-linked list (no arrays). Advisor-requested
form: `Node` type with `keyOf : Node → Nat` and `nextOf : Node → Node`
maps, defined above as honest Lean functions over the state.

## The example in plain English

A sorted singly-linked list. Each node has a *key* (natural number)
and a *next* pointer (another node or NULL). Inserting a new value
into a sorted list **without duplicating an existing key** is done by
scanning from the head until the first node whose key is **strictly
greater** than the target, then splicing the new node in just before
that node.

## Where the bug lives

The buggy scan uses `≤` instead of `<`. When the target value already
appears in the list, the scan walks *past* the equal node and the
splice phase inserts a duplicate after the original.

## Mathematical statement

  Pre:  a finite sorted list  L = (k₁, k₂, …, kₙ)  with kᵢ < kᵢ₊₁,
        head pointing at k₁, and a target value `t` such that
        ∃ j. k_j = t   (i.e. `t` is already in the list).

  Buggy program:  insert(t) using the loop guard `key[curr] ≤ t`.

  Post:  reachable state where L′ = (k₁, …, k_j, t, k_{j+1}, …, kₙ)
         contains two adjacent copies of `t`.  → the duplicate is a bug.

Below we instantiate this at n = 2 with  L = (1, 3),  t = 3.

## Concrete initial configuration

  head    = 1
  keyOf 1 = 1,  nextOf 1 = 2
  keyOf 2 = 3,  nextOf 2 = 0     -- NULL terminator
  keyOf 3 = 0,  nextOf 3 = 0     -- pre-allocated free slot for new node
  target  = 3,  prev = 0 (NULL sentinel),  curr = 1

## The buggy algorithm (informal)

    while curr ≠ 0 ∧ keyOf curr ≤ target:    // BUG: should be strict `<`
      prev := curr
      curr := nextOf curr
    keyOf 3  := target                       -- initialise new node 3
    nextOf 3 := curr
    if prev = 0 then head := 3
    else nextOf prev := 3                    -- splice in

## Concrete bug trace (target = 3)

  Phase 1 — find position:
    iter 0:  curr=1, keyOf 1 = 1, 1 ≤ 3 ✓  → prev=1, curr=nextOf 1 = 2
    iter 1:  curr=2, keyOf 2 = 3, 3 ≤ 3 ✓ (BUG, equal!) → prev=2, curr=nextOf 2 = 0
    iter 2:  curr=0, guard fails (curr = 0), exit

  Phase 2 — splice (prev = 2, curr = 0):
    keyOf  3 := 3
    nextOf 3 := 0
    prev = 2 ≠ 0,  so  nextOf prev = nextOf 2 := 3

  Final list:  1 → 2 → 3 → NULL  with keys [1, 3, 3].   ← DUPLICATE.

## How the proof closes it

We split the program at the seq boundary with `seq_intro`, then:

  · Phase 1 (the loop)         — closed by  `incorrectness_auto_inv_split 2 inv`
                                  with an indexed invariant pinning
                                  (prev, curr) per iteration.

  · Phase 2 (loop-free splice) — closed by  `incorrectness_auto`.

Both phases are discharged by the *general* automation: Phase 1 by the same
invariant tactic that closes the array loop of Example 11 (only the invariant
differs), and Phase 2 by the unified loop-free dispatcher. The pointer body's
two simultaneous existentials (over the pre-values of `prev` and `curr`) are
back-solved by `il_close`'s AC-normalising fallback (`il_close_hard`), which
floats each invariant-pinned equation next to its binding `∃`.

  --   The body has two sequential pointer-dereferences
  --   (`prev := curr; curr := nextOf curr`) producing TWO simultaneous
  --   existentials over (old_prev, old_curr), both pinned by the invariant.
  --   `il_close`'s AC-fallback (`il_close_hard`) back-solves those buried

  --   closes this pointer loop too — only the invariant differs.
